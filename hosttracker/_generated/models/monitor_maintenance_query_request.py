    too and unions with the comma list, so expand=a,b and expand=a&expand=b ask the same thing. Sending it REPLACES
    the endpoint's defaults, so `expand=` on its own asks for the leanest row - present and empty, which is not the
    same as not sending it. Nothing relational is ever on by default: a list returns bare rows and a single read
    returns the resource's own detail. On a row that belongs to a monitor, `monitor.<value>` (settings,
    subscription, lastIncident, maintenance) embeds that block inside the row's `monitor` object and implies
    `monitor` itself. """

    returns the id and the monitor block. An unrecognised name is refused, never dropped, and the refusal lists what
    this row publishes. `id` is accepted on every row, including the rows that publish no `id` member - there it
    simply keeps nothing, and a mask that would keep NOTHING at all (`fields=` or `fields=id` on such a row) is
